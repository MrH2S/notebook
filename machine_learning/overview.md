## classification
- supervised learning : limit data to a function
- unsupervised learning : learning without feedback
- reinforcement learning : learing with gain

## classic methods

classification | classic methods
---------------|----------------
supervised learning | KNN, NB, HMM, SVM, NN,RR
unsupervised learning | HMM, clusturing, filter
reinforcement learning |

## common algorithm

algorithm | classification | class | limit | apply aspect
----------|----------------|-------|-------|-----------
KNN | supervised learning | instance based | strong in limit of istance, but easy be influenced by dimensions | problem based on distance
NB | supervised learning | probability based | independent inputs | probability of class in problem domain bigger than zero
HMM | un/supervised learning | Markov | the info of sys meet Markov's limit | time series data and memoryless info
